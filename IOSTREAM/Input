Reading and writing files is a fundamental part of programming. 
File handling in Java involves classes such as FileReader, BufferedReader, FileWriter, and BufferedWriter.
Remember that in Java, characters are case-sensitive by default, 
but we can make our comparisons case-insensitive if needed.
Real-world applications like log processors, data parsers, and text analysis tools frequently work with file input.
